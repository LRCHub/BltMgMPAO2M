[00:10.53] Let's sing a song full of hope, full of pain
[00:15.66] Why don't you sing along my friend, for it's our last refrain
[00:21.30] Forever young, ever strong, ever brave
[00:26.47] Memories like this never end, no, they don't fade away
[00:53.47] 
[00:31.18] So when I'm gone, oh when I'm gone
[00:36.51] I'll be right there, close to the sun
[00:41.67] Keep holdin' on, keep holdin' on
[00:47.20] And I'll be right there, close to the sun
[00:52.15] Close to the sun
[01:00.15] 
[01:03.04] Close to the sun
[01:11.04] 
[01:26.25] Here's to the one to let shine through the rain
[01:31.17] The ones who stood for something more
[01:34.07] We won't forget your names
[01:37.04] The tide is high, say goodbye, we're settin' sail
[01:41.97] And all those midnight secrets told, we'll take 'em to the graves
[02:14.47] 
[01:46.67] So when I'm gone, oh when I'm gone
[01:52.18] I'll be right there, close to the sun
[01:57.23] Keep holdin' on, keep holdin' on
[02:02.93] And I'll be right there, close to the sun
[02:07.58] Close to the sun
[02:15.58] 
[02:29.36] Close to the sun
[02:37.36] 
[02:51.42] So when I'm gone, oh when I'm gone
[02:56.87] I'll be right there, close to the sun
[03:01.92] Keep holdin' on, keep holdin' on
[03:07.66] And I'll be right there, close to the sun
[03:12.30] Close to the sun
